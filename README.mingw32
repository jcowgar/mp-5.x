Building a Minimum Profit win32 executable with mingw32
=======================================================

    $ CC=i586-mingw32msvc-cc WINDRES=i586-mingw32msvc-windres \
	AR=i586-mingw32msvc-ar ./config.sh
    $ make

Substitute CC and WINDRES with the names of your mingw32 c compiler
and Windows resource compiler, respectively, if they are different from these.
You'll end up with a usable wmp.exe.
